# Impulse XDR 

#### Deep Security Visibility & Protection

Impulse XDR is the easiest way to start monitoring your servers and endpoints including VPS, VPC, VMs, Droplets or Linux/Windows 10/11 machines. 

Whether your goal is to secure a single VPS server or large cloud network (VPC), Impulse will help you get there. Set up deep visibility and protection for your infrastucture in two steps: 

1. Install the self-hosted security events manager on one of your existing instances. It runs on all major Linux distributions and requires almost no configuration. 

2. Deploy a light or heavy sensor on each endpoint, depending on the features and level of visibility that you need. 

That's it. Security telemetry and analytics start flowing to your screen! 

Impulese provides integrity monitoring for every aspect of your environment - files, processes, connections, ports, users, authentications, installed packages, kernel modules, etc. every variable that could be an indicator of compromise is tracked and analysed.

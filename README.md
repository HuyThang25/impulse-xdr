# Impulse XDR 

#### Deep Security Visibility & Protection

Impulse XDR is the easiest way to start monitoring your servers and endpoints including VPS, VPC, VMs, Droplets or Linux/Windows 10/11 machines. 

Whether your goal is to secure a single VPS server or large cloud network (VPC), Impulse will help you get there. Set up deep visibility and protection for your infrastucture in two steps: 

1. Install the self-hosted security events manager on one of your existing instances. It runs on all major Linux distributions and requires almost no configuration. 

2. Deploy a light or heavy sensor on each endpoint, depending on the features and level of visibility that you need. 

That's it. Security telemetry and analytics start flowing to your screen!

## Main Features:

#### Security Analytics
Ingests telemetry data from its fleet of monitoring sensors and provides security analytics & insights.

#### Indicators of Compormise
Built-in core indicators of compromise track security events on hosts and alert you in case of anomalous activity.

Event if certain events don't generate a detection, they are still added to the "IOCs History" database which provides integrity monitoring for every aspect of your environment - files, processes, connections, ports, users, authentications, installed packages, kernel modules, etc. every variable that could be an indicator of compromise is tracked and analysed.

#### Network Visibility & IDS
Monitors network flows, detects intrusion attempts and automatically blocks offenders with active response.

#### File Integrity Monitoring
Tracks changes on the filesystem tree and notifies you about file or permission modifications.

#### Security Policies
Monitors system configuration settings to ensure compliance with preset core security policies.

#### Active Response
Automatically blocks suspicious IPs, stops processes, closes ports and quarantines files.

#### Fleet firewall
Fleet firewall blocks offenders across the fleet.

#### Malware scanner
Integrated with VirursTotal to scan for malicious files on your hosts.

#### Active Response
Integrated with several high-quality threat intelligence providers to enrich your context data.

#### Self-Hosted & Open-Core
Data never leaves you servers.
